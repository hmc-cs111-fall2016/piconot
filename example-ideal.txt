// The tilde means if we are blocked in that direction
state 0 {
	S -> go S
	~S -> changeState 1
}

state 1 {
	W -> go W
	else -> changeState 2
}

state 2 {
	N -> go N
	else -> go E && changeState 3	
}

state 3 {
	S -> go S
	else -> go E && changeState 2
}


For the internal we compromised the design to make it a little simpler so rules
will be written like this:
"0N~S" -> "go S changeState 1"
