# This is an example which uses relative directions (eg forward, right, etc.)
# to solve the empty room:

state move_up
    | move forward
    | move right, face backward, move_down
    | face left, move_left

state move_down
    | move forward
    | face backward, move_up

state move_left
    | move forward
    | face left, move_down

# This is the same example, but using absolute directions (eg north, west,
# etc.) Our language supports both methods of specifying directions.

state move_north
    | move north
    | move east, face south, move_south
    | face west, move_west

state move_south
    | move south
    | face north, move_north

state move_west
    | move west
    | face south, move_south
