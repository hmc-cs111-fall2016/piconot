# Design

*Note:* I didn't do any design, because I didn't want to influence _your_ 
design. Instead, I implemented a Scala version of the official Picobot syntax,
so that--when you look at this sample solution--you can focus on the 
implementation techniques, rather than the design. 

## Who is the target for this design, e.g., are you assuming any knowledge on the part of the language users?

## Why did you choose this design, i.e., why did you think it would be a good idea for users to express the maze-searching computation using this syntax?

## What behaviors are easier to express in your design than in Picobot’s original design?  If there are no such behaviors, why not?

## What behaviors are more difficult to express in your design than in Picobot’s original design? If there are no such behaviors, why not?

## On a scale of 1–10 (where 10 is “very different”), how different is your syntax from PicoBot’s original design?

## Is there anything you would improve about your design?
